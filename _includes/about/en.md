Hey, I am Daniel Guitron (a.k.a. @dangu, @danguitron)

Data Scientist | Machine Learning Advocate | Business Strategist | Lifelong Learner | Fitness Enthusiast

Welcome to my corner of the internet‚Äîwhere spreadsheets meet sprint intervals, neural networks coexist with morning routines, and business strategy blends with barbells. I‚Äôm obsessed with one question: How do we optimize systems‚Äîwhether in code, boardrooms, or our own lives‚Äîto unlock extraordinary outcomes?

**What I Do**
--- 

üîç Data Science & Machine Learning
I turn raw data into actionable intelligence. From building predictive models that forecast market trends to designing ML pipelines that automate decision-making, I thrive on solving problems where numbers meet nuance. Recent obsessions:

- Deploying ethical AI to reduce bias in hiring algorithms.

- Using NLP to decode customer sentiment from messy, real-world text.

üíº Business Strategy
Data is useless without context. I partner with companies to translate insights into strategy‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs optimizing supply chains with ML, pricing models that balance profit and fairness, or dashboards that turn executives into data evangelists.

**How I Grow**

üß† Personal Growth as a Science

- Learning in Public: Sharing my wins (and Python errors) through blog posts and open-source projects.

-  Kaizen Philosophy: Tiny, daily improvements‚Äîlike a 1% better model accuracy or a 5-minute longer meditation streak.

-  Biohacking Meets Data: Tracking sleep, workouts, and focus with wearables (Oura Ring + Whoop) to optimize mental and physical performance.

üí™ Fitness: My Algorithm for Resilience

- Lifting Heavy Stuff: Squats > spreadsheets for stress relief. Chalistenics current goal: (muscle-up)

- The Gym as a Lab: Applying periodization principles from weightlifting to project management (yes, deload weeks exist for code too).

- Mind-Body Connection: If overfitting a model is bad, overtraining a muscle is worse. Balance is everything.

**Why These Threads Connect**
---

To me, data science, business, and fitness are all about patterns:

- A well-tuned ML model mirrors a smart training plan‚Äîboth require iteration, feedback loops, and avoiding overcomplication.

- Scaling a business is like progressive overload: sustainable growth beats short-term spikes.

- Personal growth? That‚Äôs the ultimate hyperparameter tuning.

**Philosophy**

> ‚úç Dangu¬¥s: "Perfection is a mirage; mastery is a journey.
The mind, like a muscle, grows only when stretched beyond comfort.
Every error in code, every misstep in the gym, every 'wrong' hypothesis
is a synapse forging resilience.
Stay hungry. Stay humble.
The horizon of knowledge expands only when we dare to wander."
