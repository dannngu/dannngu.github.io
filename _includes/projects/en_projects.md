## ðŸ§³ Projects

### Kidney Disease Classification
- **Description**: Developed a deep learning-based solution for classifying kidney disease using medical image data. Leveraged VGG16 architecture and modern MLOps tools to ensure model traceability, version control, and reproducibility.
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, MLflow, DVC, AWS. 
- **Link**: [View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/dannngu/kidney-disease-classification) | [Live Demo](https://render-vcgo.onrender.com/)
- **Highlights**:
    - Achieved ~80% accuracy using a VGG16-based convolutional neural network.
    - Integrated MLflow for experiment tracking and DVC for data and model version control.
    - Followed object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure modular, reusable, and maintainable code
    - Deployed workflows to AWS for scalable execution and storage.

### Schizophrenia Detection with Machine Learning
- **Description**: Designed a machine learning pipeline to detect schizophrenia from clinical data, aiming to support early diagnosis and enhance treatment planning. Focused on model performance, production-readiness, and reproducibility.
- **Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Cookiecutter, Jupyter Notebooks, NumPy.
- **Link**: [View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/dannngu/schizophrenia-detection) | [Live Demo](#)
- **Highlights**:
    - Achieved a 75% F1 score, outperforming baseline models by 15% and providing a robust tool for early-stage schizophrenia detection.
    - Deployed the model into a production environment, enabling integration with clinical workflows for real-world evaluation.
    - Cut deployment setup time by 40% using Cookiecutter templates, streamlining collaboration and ensuring consistent project structure.
