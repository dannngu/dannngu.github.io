## ðŸ§³ Projects

### ANOMALENS: Identification of Visual Anomalies in the Industrial Sector
- **Description**: I have implemented an industrial image anomaly identification system that uses transfer learning and a feature autoencoder to detect multi-scale defects in feature space, not just pixels. The architecture includes image preprocessing, ResNet50 feature maps, autoencoder, anomaly mapping, error scoring, defect classification, and action triggering.
- **Link**: [This projects is private](https://github.com/dannngu/) | [Live Demo](https://render-vcgo.onrender.com/)
- **Highlights**:
    - Accuracy (86%): Reduces false alarms, saving time and costs
    - Recall (82%): Detects real defects early, reducing failure rate
    - F1 Score (0.83): Balances accuracy and recall for reliable decisions
    - Downtime Reduction: Prevents cascading failures from undetected anomalies

### DESEASE: Diagnostic Support in the Health Sector
- **Description**: I have developed a deep learning solution using a VGG16-based CNN model trained on labeled medical images. This system, with 87% accuracy, can be deployed as a web application, allowing physicians or patients to upload images and receive instant predictive feedback. The architecture includes Data Preprocessing, VGG16 Feature Extraction, Classification, and management with MLflow/DVC and GitDS-flow for scalable deployment on AWS.
- **Link**: [View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/dannngu/kidney-disease-classification) | [Live Demo](https://render-vcgo.onrender.com/)
- **Highlights**:
    - Achieved ~80% accuracy using a VGG16-based convolutional neural network.
    - Integrated MLflow for experiment tracking and DVC for data and model version control.
    - Followed object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure modular, reusable, and maintainable code
    - Deployed workflows to AWS for scalable execution and storage.
